				In the summer of 2016; whilst accounting for limited capital, time and manpower I led a team of mathematicians in designing a 120ft suspension bridge, in a remote location in Goa, India. An iterative process was required to solve many of the project threatening problems; when our planned method would falter it was imperative we pulled through, returning to the drawing board we would re-evaluate the predicament and produce an ever more elegant solution. The bridge still stands today, after two monsoon seasons, it is testimony to our skills at perseverance, patience and ingenuity. The local market is the lifeline of the village, this bridge reduces the commute from two hours to 20 minutes, as well as connecting families separated by a treacherous river.

				Experiencing and living in a culture outside my own was an eye-opening experience. It is impossible to describe how that time has affected me as a person, profoundly shaping my values, outlook and perceptions. Aside from character building, working on a large-scale project with such a diverse team, developed and tested my problem solving and engineering skills. On a daily basis, project threatening issues would arise requiring innovative and fast solutions. 
			</p>
			<p id="content2p" align="right">
				Building the bridge during the monsoon season was the source of most issues, however this was the only time available to us as students. During this season the river is at maximum capacity, the water was treacherous. Falling in would be fatal therefore we needed to develop a way of safely constructing the bridge. The solution was to build the bridge from the outside, inwards. We started by placing the pulleys on top of the steel pillars, running the cables along the pulleys. From here we could loosely fasten the wooden planks onto the bottom cables. As the planks were only loosely  fixed, it allowed us to slide them out onto the river. Creating a harness by attaching ourselves to the top cable, we could then crawl out onto the planks, tightening them as we went, once a plank was tightened we could advance to the next. This process was iterated for over 80 individually hand cut planks.

			</figure>
			<p id="content2p" align="left">
				Whilst in the UK we anticipated that in such wet conditions we would be unable to secure the cement and steel beams ourselves, the weather would make it impossible for the cement to dry. To accommodate this, we hired a local contractor to pour the cement months before we arrived. This came with its own issues as the original workers ran off with the money! Another contractor was hired; however it was too late and the cement was unable to set properly, the result of this was that midway through the project the cement holding the steel beams began to crack. The steel beams would not be strong enough on their own (once the bridge was finished, all pressure on the front supports would be directed downwards). If the cement had thoroughly set, the foundations would have been strong enough to support the bridge during construction however, as this was not the case, we had to rethink the whole development of the bridge. We began by reinforcing the front pillars with the excess cable we had, fixing them to the back ones. In conjunction with this, across the bridge, we connected the top and bottom cables, forcing the pressure downwards on the supports.

				The reaction of the locals during the opening ceremony of the bridge made all the time, effort and stress worthwhile. To this date, the genuine
				smile and pleasure on the faces of the locals as they walked across the bridge for the first time is the most memorable experience I have ever had.

				<h2> Star Explorer </h2>

The project inputs an image of an absorption spectra from a star (note this would work with any absorption spectra, it 
does not have to be from a star), this image is turned into an array of Pixel objects; these objects hold only the relevant 
information, such as the position of the pixel on the image and whether the pixel is black and white. This array is then 
compared with similar arrays that represent inputted emission spectrums for different elements; if there is a match, then 
the name of the element is returned as well as the accuracy of the result. </p>

This project was my third attempt at a large Computer Science project, it served as an accumulation of all the knowledge I 
learned from studying Computer Science at A-Level for the past year as well as spending the last year self-teaching myself Java. 
Initially starting off with this project I had no knowledge of OO techniques, I had read about them but I had not completely 
grasped the concept; it was halfway through this project after I had created the first fully functioning procedural prototype 
that OO finally clicked. I then went back and re-coded the whole project in an OO manor, teaching myself how classes, inheritance
and encapsulation worked, incorporating all these techniques into the finished project. Although there were many set-backs, 
I still managed to complete the project way before the May 2017 deadline to a standard that with very broad guidelines and 
extremely minimal help I was, and my clients were, happy with. </p>

			image to be selected.</p>
			<p> In the above demo, the second image to be analysed is the same as the last image, however sodium has not been "seen" by the program yet, 
			once the element is added, then the software is able to analyse the element sodium.</p>

				<h2> Extended Project - Bridge Strength Analysis </h2>
				<p>
				This project aimed at modelling the stress and load experienced by a suspension bridge, comparing these values to the maximum 
				strength of the materials to determine the max load on the bridge. </p>
				<p>
This software was designed as a precursor to the Suspension Bridge we would build in India, calculating the measurements we would be 
using. This was procedurally programmed, and therefore was limited in its uses from a software side. Bringing together all the 
knowledge from my different A-Level subjects into one project; this software was extremely maths heavy from a mechanical perspective, 
meaning the mechanics modules I was studying as well as my Physics came into use.</p><p>
As an afterthought, going to India with an idea and a plan although it was somewhat vague gave us a sense that this monumental task 
was possible.
